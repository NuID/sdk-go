This repo provides a Ruby Gem for interacting with NuID APIs within Ruby
applications.

Read the latest [gem
docs](https://rubydoc.info/gems/nuid-sdk/) or
checkout the [platform docs](https://portal.nuid.io/docs) for API docs, guides,
video tutorials, and more.

## Install

From [rubygems](https://rubygems.org/gems/nuid-sdk):

```sh
gem install nuid-sdk -v "0.1.1"
```

Or with bundler:

```ruby
# Gemfile
gem "nuid-sdk", "~> 0.1.1"
```

## Usage

Example rails auth controller.

For a more detailed example visit the [Integrating with
NuID](https://portal.nuid.io/docs/guides/integrating-with-nuid) guide and the
accompanying [examples repo](https://github.com/NuID/examples).
A ruby-specific code example is coming soon.

```ruby
require "nuid-sdk"

class UsersController < ApplicationController
  NUID_API = ::NuID::SDK::API::Auth.new(ENV["NUID_API_KEY"])

  # The registration form should send the verified credential to be
  # recorded in the NuID Auth API. The response to that interaction
  # will provide a `nu/id` key in the response which should be stored
  # with the newly created user record.
  #
  # The "verified credential" is generated by your client application
  # using `Zk.verifiableFromSecret(password)` from the `@nuid/zk` npm
  # package.
  def register
    credential_res = NUID_API.credential_create(params[:verified_credential])
    if credential_res.ok?
      user_params = params.require(:email, :first_name, :last_name)
                          .merge({nuid: credential_res.parsed_response["nu/id"]})
      @current_user = User.create(user_params)
      render json: @current_user, status: :created
    else
      render status: :bad_request
    end
  end
end
```

``` ruby
require "nuid-sdk"

class SessionsController < ApplicationController
  NUID_API = ::NuID::SDK::API::Auth.new(ENV["NUID_API_KEY"])

  # Get a challenge from the Auth API. The client form should request
  # a challenge as the first of two phases to login. Once a succesful
  # challenge has been fetched, return it to the client so a proof
  # can be generated from the challenge claims and the user's password.
  def login_challenge
    user = User.find(email: params[:email])
    return render(status: :unauthorized) unless user
    
    credential_res = NUID_API.credential_get(user.nuid)
    return render(status: :unauthorized) unless credential_res.ok?

    credential = credential_res.parsed_response["nuid/credential"]
    challenge_res = NUID_API.challenge_get(credential)
    return render(status: :unauthorized) unless credential_res.ok?

    challenge_jwt = challenge_res.parsed_response["nuid.credential.challenge/jwt"]
    render json: {challenge_jwt: challenge_jwt}
  end

  # Verify is the second part of the login process. The params
  # provided here include the user identification param (email or
  # username), the unaltered challenge_jwt retrieved in phase 1 of login
  # (see #login_challenge above), and the proof that was generated from
  # the challenge_jwt claims and the user secret.
  #
  # The "proof" is generated by your client application using
  # `Zk.proofFromSecretAndChallenge(password, challenge_jwt)` from the
  # `@nuid/zk` npm package.
  def login_verify
    user = User.find(email: params[:email])
    return render(status: :unauthorized) unless user

    verify_res = NUID_API.challenge_verify(params[:challenge_jwt], params[:proof])
    if res.ok?
      @current_user = user
      # issue session ...
      render(json: @current_user)
    else
      render(status: :unathorized)
    end
  end
end
```

## Development

You'll want to download docker to run the tests, as we depend on the
`@nuid/cli` npm package to provide a CLI you can shell out to
in the tests for generating zk crypto. After checking out the repo, run
`bin/setup` to install dependencies and create the docker environment. Then, run
`make test` to run the tests inside the running container. You can also run
`bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment, but
you'll probably want to run that in the container (use `make shell` to get a
prompt in the container).

`make clean` will stop and destroy the container and image. `make build run`
will rebuild the image and run the container.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To
release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run
`bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push
git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to
[rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
